# Tech Fusion Cruiser

#### This project involves the creation of a Bluetooth-controlled car, which demonstrates the integration of various electronic components and modules to achieve wireless control. The car is designed to be operated via Bluetooth, leveraging the HC-05 Bluetooth module for wireless communication. The core of the project is the Aries development board, which is used to execute the control code and manage the car's operations.

#### For motor control, the L298N motor driver is employed, enabling precise control of the four DC motors that power the car's movement. The entire setup is powered by a portable power bank, providing the necessary electrical power to all components. This project exemplifies a practical application of Bluetooth technology in remote vehicle control, making use of microcontroller programming, motor control, and wireless communication.
